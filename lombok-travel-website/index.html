            <h2>About Lombok</h2>
            <p>Lombok is a beautiful island located in the West Nusa Tenggara province of Indonesia. Known for its stunning beaches, waterfalls, and mountains, Lombok is a popular destination for travelers seeking adventure, relaxation, and cultural experiences.</p>
            <img src="images/lombok-beach.jpg" alt="Lombok Beach">
            <p>Lombok is often referred to as the "unspoiled Bali" due to its similarities with its more famous neighbor, but with a more laid-back and peaceful atmosphere. The island is home to a diverse range of cultures, including the indigenous Sasak people, as well as a rich history and architecture.</p>
            <h3>Getting to Lombok</h3>
            <p>The easiest way to get to Lombok is by flying into Lombok International Airport (LOP), which is located in the south of the island. From there, you can take a taxi or bus to your destination.</p>
            <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
            <p>The best time to visit Lombok is during the dry season, which runs from May to September. This is the peak tourist season, but the weather is warm and sunny, making it ideal for outdoor activities.</p>
